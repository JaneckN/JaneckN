&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm an Entry-level Java Developer and I'm looking for an opportunity to kick start my Software Engineering career.
In May 2020, I have finished an intensive Java Bootcamp (360h, 9 months) and I know it is not the end, it's just the beginning.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I work as an electrician (fully qualified), I am highlighting these qualifications, because similar to a software developer,
an electrician needs to  have the ability to think analytically, to solve problems, to follow instructions and documentation.
