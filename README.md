# About Me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm an Entry-level Java Developer and I'm looking for an opportunity to kick
start my Software Engineering career. In May 2020, I have finished an intensive Java Bootcamp (360h, 9 months) and I
know it is not the end, it's just the beginning. The biggest challenge was to find the balance between a full-time job
and the study of software development. I'm learning programming by building my own projects - you can find them in the
table below. My goal is to become a backend developer, but I also develop my front-end skills to show my work and be
familiar with full-stack development.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I work as an electrician (fully qualified). I am highlighting these
qualifications, because similar to a software developer, an electrician needs to think analytically, solve problems,
follow instructions and documentation. I want to build new skills and expand my knowledge further and switch my career
to IT.

# My Projects :eyes:

I've got 4 apps, for now, all of them are deployed on Heroku - feel free to try them. I deployed these applications
through Heroku FREE plan it means apps sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.
