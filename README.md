# About Me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm an Entry-level Java Developer and I'm looking for an opportunity to kick
start my Software Engineering career. In May 2020, I have finished an intensive Java Bootcamp (360h, 9 months) and I
know it is not the end, it's just the beginning. the biggest challenge was to find the balance between a full-time job and the study of software development.
I'm learning programming by building my own projects - you can see them in the table below. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I work as an electrician (fully qualified) . I am highlighting these  qualifications, because similar to a software developer, an electrician needs to have the ability to think analytically,
to solve problems, to follow instructions and documentation.
I want to build new skills and expand my knowledge further
